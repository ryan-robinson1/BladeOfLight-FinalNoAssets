# Usage
To create a toggle button instance, right click in the hierarchy, go to "UI" and click "Toggle Button".
Alternatively you can go to "Simple Toggle Button/Resources" and drag the prefab into the scene.

# Other info
The demo folder contains two sample scenes and a script that showcases how the buttons can be used.
Feel free to delete the folder if you don't need it. The buttons will function fine without it.
